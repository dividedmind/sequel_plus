# sequel_plus

This library starts the collection of plugins and possibly extension I assemble for the Ruby Sequel 
ORM.  

Currently, it only contains a plugin for Trees to mimic the Rails acts_as_tree plugin.

NOTE:  Authors of other plugins and extensions for Sequel are welcome to contact me for inclusion
of your plugin and extension to this project.
